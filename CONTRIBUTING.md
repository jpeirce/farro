## Documentation Contributions

High-quality documentation is crucial for the FARRO project. Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to documentation:

1.  **Review Process:** All significant documentation changes should go through a review process similar to code changes (e.g., pull requests, peer review).
2.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Write clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon where possible, and explain technical terms when necessary.
3.  **Structure:** Use clear headings, lists, and short paragraphs to make content skimmable.
4.  **Accuracy:** Ensure documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase and architecture.
5.  **Version Control:** All documentation is version-controlled alongside the code. Major architectural documents should follow a `vX.Y.md` versioning scheme.
6.  **Diagrams:** Use Mermaid for text-based diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.
7.  **Glossary:** Refer to and contribute to the `docs/GLOSSARY.md` for consistent terminology. Link terms on their first occurrence or when critical for context.
