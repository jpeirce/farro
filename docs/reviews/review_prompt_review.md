# Review of `review_prompt.md`

This document reviews the prompt provided for reviewing the `architecture_design_v3.md`.

The change aims to generate a clear and actionable prompt for the `/review` role to assess the v3 architecture design.

## Evaluation

The prompt is well-structured, clear, and comprehensive. It effectively guides the reviewer towards a thorough and valuable analysis of the architecture document.

### Blocking Issues

None.

### Strong Suggestions

None.

### Nice-to-haves

-   **Suggest a structure for the feedback:** The prompt could suggest a structure for the feedback file itself, similar to how this review is structured (e.g., "Blocking issues", "Strong suggestions", "Nice-to-haves"). This would help to standardize the output of reviews and make them easier to consume. For example, the prompt could add: "Structure your feedback into 'Blocking Issues', 'Strong Suggestions', and 'Nice-to-haves' to prioritize the feedback."

## Conclusion

The prompt is excellent and ready to be used. The "nice-to-have" is a minor suggestion for future improvement and does not block the current review process.
